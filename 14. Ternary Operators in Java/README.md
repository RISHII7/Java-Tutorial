# Ternary Operator in Java

The **Ternary Operator** in Java is a concise way to perform conditional statements. It is the only operator in Java that takes three operands, hence the name "ternary." The ternary operator is often used as a shorthand for `if-else` statements, allowing you to write conditional expressions in a more compact form.
