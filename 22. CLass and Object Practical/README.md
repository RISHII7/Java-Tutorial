# Calculator Program in Java

This document describes a simple calculator program implemented in Java that performs addition of two integers using classes and methods.

## Overview

The program consists of two classes:

- **Calculator**: This class contains a method for performing addition.
- **Main**: This class contains the `main` method, which serves as the entry point for the program.

## 1. Calculator Class

The `Calculator` class includes:

- **Method: `add(int n1, int n2)`**:
  - **Parameters**: Takes two integers as input.
  - **Functionality**: Calculates the sum of the two integers.
  - **Return Value**: Returns the result of the addition.
  - **Print Statement**: Outputs a message indicating that the `add` method has been invoked.

## 2. Main Class

The `Main` class contains the `main` method, which performs the following:

- **Variable Declaration**: Initializes two integers, `num1` and `num2`, with values 4 and 5 respectively.
- **Object Creation**: Creates an instance of the `Calculator` class named `calc`.
- **Method Invocation**: Calls the `add` method of the `calc` object, passing `num1` and `num2` as arguments.
- **Output**: Prints the result of the addition to the console.

## Execution

When the program is executed, it will display:
