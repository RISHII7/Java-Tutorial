## Introduction to `if-else` Statements

The `if-else` statement is a decision-making statement that executes a block of code based on whether a specified condition evaluates to `true` or `false`. It allows your program to take different actions based on varying conditions.

```java
if (condition) {
    // Code to execute if the condition is true
} else {
    // Code to execute if the condition is false
}
