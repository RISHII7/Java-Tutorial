# Switch Statements in Java

The **Switch Statement** in Java is a control flow statement that is used to execute one block of code among many based on the value of an expression. It's an alternative to using multiple `if-else-if` conditions and makes the code more readable when handling multiple possible outcomes for a single variable.

## Syntax

```java
switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // code block for case value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // code block for case value2
        break;
    // You can add more cases as needed
    default:
        // code block for default case
}
