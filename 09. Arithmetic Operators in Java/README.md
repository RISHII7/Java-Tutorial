## Introduction to Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations on numeric data types in Java. They are fundamental to programming and are commonly used for calculations in various applications. The following section lists the most commonly used arithmetic operators.

## List of Arithmetic Operators

Here are the arithmetic operators available in Java:

| Operator | Description                | Example        | Result     |
|----------|----------------------------|----------------|------------|
| `+`      | Addition                   | `5 + 3`        | `8`        |
| `-`      | Subtraction                | `5 - 3`        | `2`        |
| `*`      | Multiplication             | `5 * 3`        | `15`       |
| `/`      | Division                   | `5 / 2`        | `2` (integer division) |
| `%`      | Modulus (Remainder)        | `5 % 2`        | `1`        |

### Note:
- In Java, when performing division with integers, the result is also an integer (i.e., any decimal portion is discarded). For example, `5 / 2` yields `2`, not `2.5`.




 Understanding Increment and Decrement Operators in Java

This document provides an overview of increment and decrement operators in Java, detailing how they work and providing examples of their usage in Java programs.

## Introduction to Increment and Decrement Operators

In Java, increment and decrement operators are used to increase or decrease the value of a variable by one, respectively. They are unary operators, meaning they operate on a single operand. These operators are commonly used in loops and other control structures to manipulate counters and iterators efficiently.

## Types of Increment and Decrement Operators

Java provides two types of increment and decrement operators:

### 1. Increment Operator (`++`)

The increment operator increases the value of a variable by one. It can be used in two forms:

- **Post-increment (`variable++`)**: Increases the variable's value **after** the current expression is evaluated.
- **Pre-increment (`++variable`)**: Increases the variable's value **before** the current expression is evaluated.

### 2. Decrement Operator (`--`)

The decrement operator decreases the value of a variable by one. Similar to the increment operator, it can be used in two forms:

- **Post-decrement (`variable--`)**: Decreases the variable's value **after** the current expression is evaluated.
- **Pre-decrement (`--variable`)**: Decreases the variable's value **before** the current expression is evaluated.
