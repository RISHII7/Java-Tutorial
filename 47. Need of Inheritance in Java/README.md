# Why Do We Need Inheritance in Java?

## 1. Code Reusability
Inheritance allows a class to inherit methods and fields from another class, eliminating the need to rewrite common functionality. This reduces code duplication and enhances maintainability.

## 2. Method Overriding
It supports **method overriding**, allowing a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass. This promotes flexibility in defining behavior for subclasses.

## 3. Hierarchical Structure
Inheritance helps model a natural hierarchy between classes, where higher-level classes represent general behavior and lower-level classes specialize in specific functionality.

## 4. Extensibility
It makes code more extensible. New functionality can be added to existing code by creating subclasses, without modifying the existing codebase.

## 5. Code Maintainability
By centralizing common functionality in the parent class, inheritance simplifies the process of maintaining code. Updates to the parent class automatically apply to all subclasses, reducing the risk of inconsistencies and bugs.

## 6. Avoids Code Duplication
With inheritance, common code is written once in the parent class and shared across multiple subclasses, leading to cleaner and more organized code.
