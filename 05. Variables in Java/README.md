# Variables in Java

In Java, a variable is a fundamental concept used to store data values. Variables act as containers for data that can change during the execution of a program. This document provides an in-depth overview of variables in Java, including their types, declaration, initialization, scope, and usage.

## 1. What is a Variable?

A variable is a named memory location that can hold a value. The value of a variable can change throughout the program. 

### Example:
```java
int number; // Declaration of a variable named 'number' of type int
number = 10; // Initialization of 'number' with the value 10
