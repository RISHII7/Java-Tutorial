# Mutable vs Immutable Strings in Java

In Java, **strings** can either be **mutable** or **immutable** based on how they are handled in memory. Understanding the difference between mutable and immutable strings is crucial for efficient memory management and better performance in string operations.

## Immutable Strings

An **immutable** object is an object whose state (data) cannot be changed after it is created. In Java, objects of the `String` class are immutable. This means that once a `String` object is created, its value cannot be altered.

### Characteristics of Immutable Strings:
- When a new string is assigned, a new memory location is created.
- Any modification to an immutable string results in the creation of a new `String` object, while the old object remains unchanged.
- Strings are stored in a **string pool** for memory efficiency. If the same string literal is used multiple times, Java refers to the same string object from the pool rather than creating a new one.
  
### Example:
```java
String str1 = "Hello";
str1 = str1.concat(" World"); // A new String object "Hello World" is created
```
In this example, the string "Hello" is stored in memory, and when " World" is concatenated, a new string "Hello World" is created. The original string "Hello" remains unchanged.

### Advantages of Immutable Strings:
- **Thread Safety:** Since the state of a string cannot be changed, it is inherently thread-safe and can be shared between multiple threads without synchronization.
- **Security:** Immutable objects are more secure because their values cannot be altered accidentally or maliciously.
- **Caching:** String literals are stored in the String pool, which optimizes memory usage by reusing the same string objects.

## Mutable Strings
In contrast, mutable objects can be modified after they are created. Java provides classes like StringBuilder and StringBuffer to handle mutable strings. These classes allow for in-place modifications without creating new objects, making them more memory-efficient when performing repeated string operations.

### Characteristics of Mutable Strings:
- Mutable strings can change their content without creating new objects.
- Both StringBuilder and StringBuffer offer methods like append(), insert(), delete(), which directly modify the original string.

**Example:**
```java
StringBuilder str2 = new StringBuilder("Hello");
str2.append(" World"); // The original object is modified to "Hello World"
```
In this example, the StringBuilder object allows us to modify the original string directly without creating a new object.

## Differences between StringBuilder and StringBuffer:
- **StringBuilder:** Not synchronized and faster in performance. It is preferable when thread safety is not a concern.
- **StringBuffer:** Synchronized and thread-safe but slower compared to StringBuilder. Useful in multi-threaded environments where string operations need to be synchronized.

## Advantages of Mutable Strings:
- **Performance:** When performing multiple string manipulations, mutable objects are faster since they do not create new objects for every change.
- **Memory Efficiency:** Mutable strings avoid the overhead of creating multiple objects, which can save memory in applications that involve frequent string modifications.
