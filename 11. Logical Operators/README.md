# Logical Operators in Java

Logical operators in Java are used to combine multiple conditions and produce a boolean result (`true` or `false`). These operators are essential in control flow, allowing developers to make decisions based on multiple boolean expressions.

## Types of Logical Operators

Java provides three main logical operators:

1. **AND (`&&`)**
2. **OR (`||`)**
3. **NOT (`!`)**

# Logical AND (`&&`) Operator in Java

In Java, the **Logical AND (`&&`)** operator is used to combine two or more boolean expressions. The result will be `true` **only** if all conditions are true. If any condition is false, the entire expression evaluates to `false`.

## Syntax

condition1 && condition2



# Logical OR (`||`) Operator in Java

The **Logical OR (`||`)** operator in Java is used to combine two or more boolean expressions. The result of the expression is `true` if at least one of the conditions is true. If all conditions are false, the entire expression evaluates to `false`.

---

## Syntax

condition1 || condition2


# Logical NOT (`!`) Operator in Java

The **Logical NOT (`!`)** operator in Java is a unary operator that is used to negate a boolean expression. It inverts the value of the expression, converting `true` to `false` and vice versa. This operator is essential for controlling the flow of a program based on conditions.

## Syntax

!condition
