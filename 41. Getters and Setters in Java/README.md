# Getters and Setters in Java

In Java, **getters** and **setters** are methods used to retrieve and update the values of private fields of a class. They are part of a concept known as **Encapsulation**, where the internal state of an object is hidden from the outside world and only exposed through controlled methods.

## Why Use Getters and Setters?

1. **Encapsulation**: 
   Getters and setters allow you to enforce encapsulation. By keeping the class fields private, you ensure that they cannot be directly accessed from outside the class, providing better control over the data.
   
2. **Controlled Access**:
   - **Getter**: Allows you to retrieve the value of a private field.
   - **Setter**: Allows you to update the value of a private field while optionally adding validation logic.
   
3. **Data Validation**: Setters can include validation logic to ensure that the data being assigned is valid.
   
4. **Flexibility**: By using getters and setters, you can change the internal representation of a class (such as using a different data type for a field) without affecting external code.

## Structure of Getters and Setters

- **Getter**: A method that retrieves the value of a field. It usually has the following characteristics:
  - The method name starts with `get`.
  - It returns the value of the field.
  - It does not take any parameters.
  
- **Setter**: A method that updates the value of a field. It usually has the following characteristics:
  - The method name starts with `set`.
  - It returns `void` (i.e., it does not return any value).
  - It takes one parameter, the new value of the field.

## Naming Conventions

- **Getter**: `getFieldName()`
- **Setter**: `setFieldName(fieldValue)`

In Java, the standard naming convention for getters and setters is to capitalize the first letter of the field name after `get` or `set`.

For example, if the field is `age`, the getter and setter methods would be named `getAge()` and `setAge(int age)`.

## Example: Getters and Setters

```java
class Person {
    // Private fields (attributes)
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // Getter for name
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Setter for name
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;  // 'this' refers to the current object's field
    }

    // Getter for age
    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    // Setter for age
    public void setAge(int age) {
        // Optional validation logic
        if (age >= 0) {
            this.age = age;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Age cannot be negative.");
        }
    }
}

public class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a new Person object
        Person person = new Person();

        // Set values using setters
        person.setName("Alice");
        person.setAge(25);

        // Get values using getters
        System.out.println("Name: " + person.getName());
        System.out.println("Age: " + person.getAge());
    }
}
```

### Key Points:
1. **Private Fields:** The `name` and `age` fields are marked as `private`, which means they cannot be accessed directly from outside the `Person` class.

2. **Getter Methods:** The methods `getName()` and `getAge()` allow controlled access to the private fields `name` and `age`, respectively.

3. **Setter Methods:** The methods `setName()` and `setAge()` allow controlled modification of the fields. In the `setAge()` method, there's a basic validation to ensure that the age cannot be set to a negative value.

4. **Using Getters and Setters:** In the `Demo` class, we create a `Person` object and use the setters to assign values to the private fields. We then use the getters to retrieve and print these values.

### Advantages of Getters and Setters
- **Data Encapsulation:** By using getters and setters, the internal representation of data is hidden, and access is controlled. The class can ensure that its state remains consistent and valid.
- **Flexibility:** You can change the internal implementation of a field (for example, changing the data type or adding validation) without affecting external code.
- **Consistency:** Getters and setters provide a consistent way to access and modify data across different classes.
- **Extensibility:** You can add extra logic (like validation or logging) in getters and setters without changing the way external code interacts with your class.


### Syntax for Getters and Setters
```java
// Getter
public ReturnType getFieldName() {
    return this.fieldName;
}

// Setter
public void setFieldName(DataType fieldName) {
    this.fieldName = fieldName;
}
```

### Conclusion
Getters and setters are essential building blocks in Java for implementing encapsulation and controlling access to an objectâ€™s data. They allow developers to write more maintainable and flexible code while safeguarding the internal state of an object.
