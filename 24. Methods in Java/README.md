# Understanding Methods in Java

In Java, methods are essential building blocks that enable code reusability and modular programming. They allow programmers to define a set of instructions that can be executed multiple times throughout a program. This document will explore the definition, types, syntax, and examples of methods in Java.

## What is a Method?

A **method** is a block of code that performs a specific task. It can take inputs, process them, and return an output. Methods help organize code, making it more readable and maintainable.

### Key Benefits of Using Methods:

- **Reusability**: Once a method is defined, it can be reused multiple times, reducing code duplication.
- **Organization**: Methods help to logically organize code into smaller, manageable units.
- **Maintainability**: Changes can be made in one place (the method) instead of updating every instance of the code.

## Syntax of a Method

The general syntax for defining a method in Java is as follows:

```java
access_modifier return_type method_name(parameter_list) {
    // method body
    // return statement (if return_type is not void)
}
